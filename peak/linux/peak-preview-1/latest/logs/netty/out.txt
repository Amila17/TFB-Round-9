[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for com.techempower:netty-example:jar:0.1
[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.(groupId:artifactId:type:classifier)' must be unique: com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:jar -> version 2.3.0 vs 2.1.1 @ line 22, column 17
[WARNING] 
[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.
[WARNING] 
[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.
